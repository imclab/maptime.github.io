MaptimePDX is the Portland, OR offshoot of <a href="http://maptimesf.tumblr.com/">MaptimeSF</a>, a weekly meetup of mappers in San Francisco hacking on maps and doing mappy things. In the same tradition, we're aiming to provide meetups for hacking on map projects of all sorts. There's no board or leadership - just some people who are enthusiastic about maps and sharing knowledge. We'll post upcoming events here and summaries of things we learn along the way. Join us!
