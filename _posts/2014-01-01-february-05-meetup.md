**What**: February Maptime: Demos and Hacking

**Where**: [Esri R&D Center](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267)

**When**: Wednesday, February 5, 2014 from 6â€“8:30pm

[January's meetup](http://maptimepdx.org/12-29-2013/january-16-meetup.html) was good chance to get our bearing for the year and get a sense of what we're all getting into. This month, we've got a little more structure and we will be starting the meetup with three presentations - an intro [D3](http://maptimepdx.org/01-22-2014/d3-zoom-bounds.html), [TileMill 1 & 2](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/), and the guts of the MaptimePDX site. Presos are around 10 minutes but there's time for Q&A and hands on around the topics. But by all means, **bring your own ideas and projects**! And as always, **beginners welcome** so bring your laptops.

This will be the last meetup at the [Esri R&D Center (aka Geoloqi HQ)](http://calagator.org/venues/202393267) as they are moving to new digs. Next month is up for grabs so if you know of a good location, tweet us [@maptimepdx](http://twitter.com/maptimepdx) with your idea.
