This past Wednesday's Maptime was a hit with 16 geo folk from print cartography to web dev. Presos on [CamliStore](https://camlistore.org/), [Python and Geodata BFFs](https://github.com/pdxmele/python-geodata-bffs/), and [SpatialDev Project Management Tools](http://www.spatialdev.com/). We're meeting up again this [Friday, April 4](http://calagator.org/events/1250465961) for morning coffee and brekkie so bring your projects, ideas, and appetite to [Glyph Cafe and Art Space](http://www.glyphpdx.com/).
