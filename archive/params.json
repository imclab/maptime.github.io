{"name":"Maptime!","tagline":"It's time to hack on maps!","body":"### Welcome to Maptime.\r\nMaptime is a weekly map hack night hosted at Stamen Design. We meet every Thursday at 6:30pm to work on maps, learn about geospatial data, and teach each other the latest cartographic tools.\r\n\r\n### No really, what is maptime?\r\nMaptime is inspired by the various themed hack nights that frequently happen at hackerspaces such as Noisebridge. Often these hack nights will have a specific project or lesson to work on each night, but attendees don't have to follow along if they don't want to. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions of our map experts. \r\n\r\n### What's here?\r\nThis page (and the maptime github repository and wiki) will host tutorials, project plans, etc. There's not much here yet.\r\n\r\n### What else is there?\r\nWe also have a blog at http://MaptimeSF.tumblr.com where we post updates about what happened at each meeting.\r\nYou can also follow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/MaptimeSF for meeting updates and other fun map links.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe stub of this page was created by Alan McConchie (@almccon) but anyone can edit it or suggest improvement! Maptime is a collaborative endeavor that depends on everyone's contribution!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
